Nas in the data, how to encode those
Only animate the tracts that change -- should smooth transitions greatly

Redo the show/hide of the table

Don't reveal tract map until it's been drawn

Display summary stats during transition -- number increasing, number 20%+, 40%+, pop totals, etc.
Highlight biggest changers

Allow user to switch period by using arrow keys
missing tract data?? Is there any?

Come up with a better queuing system...

	1) get tract data
	2) set callback to draw tract data after it downloads
		i) any changes to view or selecting another metro area cancels callback
		ii) you want the ability to execute the current callback when another event ends -- this allows download in background, draw when you want
